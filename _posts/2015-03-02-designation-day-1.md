In just a few short weeks, I'll be making my way to--wait for it--CHI-CITY!!! Ehrm, Chicago! And live there for three months! I'll be attending a full-stack design bootcamp called DESIGNATION and I couldn't be more excited. While I love development, I think my first love has always been design, and I think I've held it off long enough. I have been following tons of talented designers in Dribbble, listening to design podcasts while sitting in traffic, and I have only been dreaming about designing things people all over the world can use... and until today, it has only been just a dream of mine pursue something 100% creative.

I can't wait to start making my way through Photoshop and Illustrator to create amazing, well-thought-out web and app designs and expand my portfolio. The next tweleve weeks will be intense, but invigorating... and starting today, I'm finally living my dream. YES!
