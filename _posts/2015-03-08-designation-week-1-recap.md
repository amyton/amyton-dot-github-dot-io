- 22+ hours of watching Lynda videos
- 3 hours following tutorials
- 6+ hours spent on creating web design comps in Photoshop 
- 13+ hours on attempting to use the pen tool in Illustrator
- 4 Red Bulls (thanks to my friend Vanesa!)
- 1 day spent at Disneyland for a well-deserved break

It's been an amazing first week!

This was my first time actually using Illustrator I was surprised at how much I actually enjoyed using the pen tool. I mean, we've always been afraid of it once, right? Once I get to commit more Illustrator shortcuts to memory and learn more ways to work with the pen tool, I could really see myself immersing in Illustrator. I really wish I could draw, because creating vector graphics and icons seem like a lot of fun.

The most satisfying thing this week was when I realized I could now take any illustration, logo, or icon and recreate it using the new basic tools I've learned. Being able to turn a few pen strokes into an artwork gets me so excited! You have no idea.
