This was was my FIRST time learning and using the pen tool in Illustrator and it started out pretty rough. I did a little practice every day, and I <em>think</em> I'm getting a little better it at. It wasn't as scary as I thought; once I got the hang of it, I knew the pen tool and I are going to be fast friends. 

Week One's exercises were to create super hero icons and and a selfie. Here's mine: 

<ul class="small-block-grid-1 medium-block-grid-2 no-bullet">
  <li><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/self-portrait.jpg" alt="selfie illustration"/></li>
  <li><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/batman.jpg" alt="batman logo"/></li>
</ul>
